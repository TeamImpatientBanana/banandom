Banandom
========

The random banana game, made at HackGT Fall 2014

Type a random string into the box to see how well it scores! Try to get in the top 50! Scores are updated in real time on all clients.

Built on Meteor.

##Status

Development has been halted, but it'd be cool to clean up the scoring system and make it into something a little more challenging. We'd also like it if the game gave immediate feedback for answers and did other things to increase "addictiveness".
